"""Interleaved randomized-block measurement with delta-based elimination.

The whole field is measured in one process as a randomized complete block
design. Each block visits every surviving candidate once, in a fresh random
order, timing a short run of calls per visit. Blocking pairs the comparison so
drift cancels in the differences; reshuffling each block keeps position from
being confounded with the candidate.

The objective is selection rather than hypothesis testing, so candidates
within ``delta`` are treated as settled. That keeps the block count a function
of delta and the measurement noise, not of the size of the catalogue.

Two constraints on callers:

Correctness is the caller's. Entrants reach :func:`race` only through the
timing function, so nothing here sees kernel output and a candidate computing
the wrong answer races like any other. Check it in the pass that compiles and
warms each candidate, before any timed call. ``_race_one_shape`` in
``op_tests/tuners/tune_mha_fwd.py`` is the reference implementation.

Nothing here imports torch at module scope, so the decision logic is testable
on synthetic latencies. :func:`cuda_event_timer` is the GPU timing function.
