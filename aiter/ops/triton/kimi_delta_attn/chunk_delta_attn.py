"""
Kimi Delta Attention (KDA) chunked forward pass (Forward Only).

This is the public entry point for the ``chunk_delta_attn`` Triton kernels. The
signature mirrors ``fla.ops.kda.chunk_kda`` so serving stacks can swap the two
backends without reshaping tensors or re-deriving the gate.

Important Note:
    Only the forward pass is implemented. These functions do NOT support
    gradient computation. For training, use the flash-linear-attention library.

Notes on the fla-compatible surface:
    * ``state_v_first`` is spelled as fla spells it from 0.5.1 onward. fla's
      pre-0.5.1 name ``transpose_state_layout`` is deliberately not accepted, so
      a shared argument dict requires fla >= 0.5.1 on the other side.
    * ``disable_recompute`` is accepted for signature parity but has no effect.
      In both libraries it only decides whether the gated query ``qg`` is
      materialized for a backward pass to reuse -- neither forward output
      kernel reads it. Since this path is forward-only and returns no scratch,
      honouring ``True`` would allocate and write a ``T x HV x K`` tensor that
      nothing can observe, so the flag is pinned off internally.
    * ``allow_neg_eigval`` / ``return_intermediate_states`` / ``cp_context`` /
      ``cu_seqlens_cpu`` have no counterpart yet and are rejected rather than
      silently ignored.
    * Tensor arguments are made contiguous here, as fla's ``@input_guard``
      does, because some kernels below assume contiguous strides.
    * This path is forward-only, so the output carries no ``grad_fn`` even
      when the inputs require grad, whereas fla returns a differentiable
      tensor.

    Chunked Kimi Delta Attention forward pass using Triton (Forward only).

    Warning:
        Forward only; this function does NOT compute gradients.

    Args:
        q (torch.Tensor):
            queries of shape `[B, T, H, K]`.
        k (torch.Tensor):
            keys of shape `[B, T, H, K]`.
        v (torch.Tensor):
            values of shape `[B, T, HV, V]`. GVA is applied if `HV > H`, in which
            case `HV` must be divisible by `H`.
        g (torch.Tensor):
            (forget) gate of shape `[B, T, HV, K]`.
            When `use_gate_in_kernel=False` this is the pre-computed decay in log
            space; when `True` it is the raw pre-activation input and the kernel
            fuses the `A_log` / `dt_bias` activation plus the chunk cumsum.
        A_log (torch.Tensor, optional):
            per-head log-scale of shape `[HV]`. Required when
            `use_gate_in_kernel=True`.
        dt_bias (torch.Tensor, optional):
            per-K-channel bias of shape `[HV * K]`, added to `g` before the gate
            activation. Default: `None`.
        beta (torch.Tensor):
            betas of shape `[B, T, HV]`. Raw logits when
            `use_beta_sigmoid_in_kernel=True`, post-sigmoid otherwise. Pass this
            in fp32 to keep the delta-rule write strength from being rounded to
            the input dtype.
        scale (float, optional):
            Scale factor for the attention scores. Default: `1 / sqrt(K)`.
        initial_state (torch.Tensor, optional):
            Initial state of shape `[N, HV, K, V]` (`[N, HV, V, K]` when
            `state_v_first=True`), for `N` input sequences. Any float dtype; the
            recurrence accumulates in fp32 whatever the state is stored as. For
            equal-length inputs `N` equals the batch size `B`. Default: `None`.
        output_final_state (bool):
            Whether to return the final state, same shape as `initial_state`.
            Its dtype is `initial_state`'s on the FlashKDA path and fp32 on the
            default pipeline. Default: `False`.
        use_qk_l2norm_in_kernel (bool):
            Whether to L2-normalize `q` and `k` before the recurrence.
        use_gate_in_kernel (bool):
            Whether to compute the log-space decay from `g` internally.
        use_beta_sigmoid_in_kernel (bool):
            Whether to apply `sigmoid` to `beta` before the recurrence.
        safe_gate (bool):
            Whether to use the sub-chunk intra kernel, which keeps the gate
            bounded across sub-chunk boundaries. Requires `lower_bound`.
        lower_bound (float, optional):
            Lower bound of the forget gate in log space. When set, the gate
            activation becomes `lower_bound * sigmoid(exp(A_log) * (g + dt_bias))`
            instead of `-exp(A_log) * softplus(g + dt_bias)`. Kimi uses `-5.0`.
        state_v_first (bool):
            Store the recurrent state V-first (`[V, K]`) instead of `[K, V]`.
        disable_recompute (bool):
            Ignored. In fla this keeps the gated query `qg` alive for the
            backward pass; this path is forward-only and returns no scratch,
            so the flag is accepted for signature parity only.
        chunk_size (int, optional):
            Chunk size, either 32 or 64. Default: `None`, which lets the
            library choose. fla has no counterpart and pins 64 internally, so
            nothing on the shared surface sets this.

            The choice is really which kernel runs. 32 is the two-kernel
            FlashKDA path's entry ticket, and it is picked when the rest of the
            call also qualifies for it: the fused gate, in-kernel l2norm and
            beta sigmoid, `safe_gate`, and `K = V = 128` without GVA. Anything
            else gets 64, which is the faster of the two inside the default
            pipeline. Passing 32 or 64 explicitly is honoured as given.

            FlashKDA agrees with the default pipeline to bf16 rather than
            exactly, as does 32 against 64 within the default pipeline itself.
            Set `AITER_FDA_ENABLE=0` to pin the default pipeline.
        cu_seqlens (torch.LongTensor, optional):
            Cumulative sequence lengths of shape `[N+1]` for variable-length
            inputs, consistent with the FlashAttention API. Default: `None`.
        out (torch.Tensor, optional):
            Caller-owned output buffer, same shape as `v`. Required with
            `state_cache`.
        state_cache (torch.Tensor, optional):
            Paged fp32 V-first cache `[slots, H, V, K]`. Replaces
            `initial_state`: sequence `n` is row `state_indices[n]`. Each
            slot's `[H, V, K]` plane must be dense; `stride(0)` may be padded.
            FlashKDA-only; the default pipeline rejects this argument rather
            than ignoring it.
        state_indices (torch.Tensor, optional):
            Int32 `[N]` cache row per sequence. Required with `state_cache`.
        has_initial_state (torch.Tensor, optional):
            Bool `[N]`. False starts that sequence from zero. Required with
            `state_cache`.

    Returns:
        tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor | None]:
            - o (torch.Tensor): Outputs of shape `[B, T, HV, V]`.
            - final_state (torch.Tensor | None): Final state if
              `output_final_state=True` else `None`. `None` when
              `state_cache` is given, because the cache already holds it.
